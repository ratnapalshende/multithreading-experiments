# Python without GIL üöÄüåüüêç
Python community is celebrating a long-awaited milestone ‚Äî the removal of the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)! </br>
From lots of years GIL has been bottleneck for CPU bound multithreaded programs. Now python introduced version [3.13](https://docs.python.org/3.13/whatsnew/3.13.html#free-threaded-cpython) and the wait is over, we can use this experimental feature to see the performance of python with GIL removed on multithreaded programs.

## But what the heck is GIL ?
<b>Process : </b>Program is in execution state known as process.<br>
<b>Thread : </b>Thread is single unit of execution.<br>
- A process can have multiple threads.<br>
- Two or more processes cannot share the same memory directly.
- Two or more threads can access the same memory directly.

The GIL (Global Interpreter Lock) is a mutex lock that allows only one thread to execute at a time.
However, it is more than just a mutex lock.

For example, if a thread wants to execute, it sets a mutex lock. Once set, no other thread can execute without acquiring the mutex lock. Other threads must wait for the lock to be released to proceed with execution.

## What is the problem with GIL ?
Generally, if your CPU has multiple cores, you can run multiple threads in parallel. <br>However, the GIL prevents this. To make Python easier to understand and manage, Python uses reference counting for memory management.<br>
python keeps track of all refferences pointing to a object in a variable. whenever the refference count is 0 for a particular object then python removes that object from the memory, that's how python manages memory.
</br>Example:
```python
a = "hello"
b = a
```
Here you can see the refference count for String object `"hello"` is 2 pointing by `a` and `b`.<br>

If the GIL allowed multiple threads to run simultaneously, race conditions could occur, with multiple threads accessing and modifying memory at the same time. This could lead to unexpected behavior, crashes, and other issues. To avoid this, the GIL exists in Python.
<br>

Python is their from long time when operating system doesn't even know about threads that's why GIL is included in python, but now in this modern world with multi core cpus where we can run one thread on one cpu core achieving parallelism and to do that we need a way to make python faster for multithreaded programs.<br>
So to make python future proof and more resilient community is working on to remove GIL, for now in 3.13 they introduced experimental feature where devopers can test it in their enviornment.

## How to install python 3.13t in ubuntu ?
Run this commands one by one on your terminal.
```bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python3.13-nogil
```
You can verify your build of CPython itself has the GIL disabled with the following incantation:
```bash
python -VV
```
If you are using Python 3.13b1 or newer, you should see a message like:
```bash
Python 3.13.0b1+ experimental free-threading build (heads/3.13:d93c4f9, May 21 2024, 10:54:14) [Clang 15.0.0 (clang-1500.1.0.2.5)]
```
Verify that the GIL is disabled at runtime with the following command:
```bash
python -c "import sys; print(sys._is_gil_enabled())"
```
if you see the output `False` then you are good to go.

## How can I compare multithreading with GIL and without GIL version ?
Clone this repository with the command :
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ratnapalshende/multithreading-experiments.git
```

```bash
cd multithreading-experiments
```
Run `test.py` with the python version 3.12 or anything you have installed on your machine other than 3.13t.
```bash
python3 test.py
```
Now run `test.py` with the GIL disabled version 3.13t :
```bash
python3.13t test.py
```

### üõ†Ô∏è How does it impact performance?
Here‚Äôs a comparison based on benchmarks:

| **Scenario**           | **Python 3.12 (With GIL)** | **Python 3.13 (Without GIL)** |
|-------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Single-threaded         | ~3.26 seconds            | ~2.97 seconds                |
| Multi-threaded | ~3.28 seconds            | ~1.04 seconds                |
